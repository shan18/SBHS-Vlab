Introduction
============

This project provides an "exam" app that lets users take an online programming quiz.


Features
--------
* Define fairly complicated programming problems and have users solve the problem.
* Immediate verification of code solution.
* Supports pretty much arbitrary coding questions in Python, C, C++ and simple Bash and uses "test cases" to test the implementations of the students.
* Supports simple multiple choice questions and File uploads.
* Since it runs on your Python, you could technically test any Python based library.
* Scales to over 500+ simultaneous users.
* Distributed under the BSD license.
